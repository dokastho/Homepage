# Summary

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio, found on [dokasfam](https://www.dokastho.io).

## Frameworks & APIs

In order to host this website I used Python's Flask API, and built the UI with React. The main site is built entirely in React, while the administrative pages are server-side rendered with Flask & Jinja templates (for simplicity).

This site also uses my proprietary database API, d3b. [Check it out!](https://www.github.com/dokastho/d3b/).
